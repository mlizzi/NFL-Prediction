# Time Dependency in NFL Against the Spread Predictions


## Abstract
Against the spread betting is a form of sports prediction aimed at the lucrative betting market in
the National Football League. While recent revelations in the machine learning field have allowed
for research in the application of neural networks for sports prediction, this paper aims to design
new models meant specifically for increasing a bettor’s likelihood of profitability when placing
against the spread bets. The paper attempts to improve bettor profitability by accounting for
the passage of time during model creation. Through experimentation and analysis, this paper
demonstrates the difficulties of developing against the spread models and suggests how this form
of betting is often not in a bettor’s favour.
